Asteria Launcher (Asteria for short) is an **open-source**, custom Minecraft launcher written in **Python** and **Node.js (React)**, built using the **Tauri** framework. Asteria is designed for **simplicity, compatibility**, and **enhanced Minecraft version and mod management**.

## ðŸš§ Development Status ðŸš§

## ðŸŒ  Why Asteria?
The name **Asteria** is derived from Greek mythology, meaning "Star" or "Starry one." In the myth, Asteria was the Titaness of falling stars and the night sky. She symbolizes self-transformation and the pursuit of something better â€” the constant striving to evolve, improve, and reach a higher potential.
Just as Asteria sought to transcend her limitations, **Asteria Launcher** is designed to elevate the Minecraft experience, offering simplicity, better management, and enhanced flexibility to users.
Whether it's through seamless mod management, game version handling, or performance improvements, Asteria Launcher aims to empower users with a powerful tool that simplifies and enhances the Minecraft experience.
